# subfolder-pip
Testing installation from pip in a subfolder

This works:
```bash
 pip install "git+https://github.com/pdonorio/subfolder-pip.git@0a14e9507072e9713e07e44c9ca20679540f56e2#egg=subfolder&subdirectory=vendor"

# 0a14e9507072e9713e07e44c9ca20679540f56e2 is the commit in main to fix to a specific version
# "subfolder" is the name of the library in setup.py
# "vendor" is the subfolder in which the library is found
```

So then we can:

```bash
‚ùØ ipython
